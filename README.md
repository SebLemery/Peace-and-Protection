### What is PnP?
Peace and Protection (PnP) is a collection of scripts that enhances mIRC, a popular windows IRC client. PnP allows the user to set options through the use of dialog boxes and popups. PnP also comes with various addons and a slew of custom commands. It has everything a beginner, advanced or expert mIRC user needs.

This script is coded by pai. She left the scene many years ago never to return. PnP is part of her legacy.

### Improvements
* PnP 4.22 opened custom windows with the -h flag. In newer mIRC versions that translates to using the -w0 flag.
* Many smaller bugs have been found and fixed.

### Further development?
Pai had to change priorities and most likely will not continue working on PnP. Because PnP is Pai's work and something she was very proud of, and the fact that she's probably not coming back to work on it, the script will not evolve beyond what it is. 

### Mission statement
We will attempt to fix the bugs that come along, and try to make it work, but there will be no new features. If we add something or make a new feature, it will be released as separate downloadable addons, but it will not be shipped with the main script archive.
