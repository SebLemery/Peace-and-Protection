; HOW TO TRANSLATE
;
 
; Remember not to translate any text within <brackets>- these are placeholders required by the script
; For example, if you translate the phrase 'Loading file <file>', then do not translate the text <file>.
; Instead, you will place <file> in it's proper location within the phrase where the filename should appear.
 
; Some items contain a |. (pipe) This is used to separate an error or message into multiple lines.
; Anytime an item has a pipe, the translated item should contain a pipe as well. Do not add pipes
; into items that did not have them originally.
 
; Also remember that you are not translating the section and item names. For example-
;
; [section]
; item=blah blah blah
;
; Do not translate 'section' or 'item'. You are only translating the 'blah blah blah' part, keeping in
; mind the above rules relating to <brackets>, etc. Do not bother to translate comments- any line such
; as these that starts with a semicolon. (;)
 
; Try to keep capitalization of sentences the same as the originals, etc.
; Also remember that command names do not change as pat of translation- /away is still /away in any language.
; Please do not change the phrase "Peace and Protection" or the author's name "pai" to anything else.
